# The Zen Of Git

## Summary

> If you're familiar with Git and want to dig deeper, this is the workshop for you. We'll learn a bit about some advanced Git commands, as well as cover workflows for collaborating with others and perhaps some Git internals if time permits.
>
> You should bring a laptop with Git installed, so you can follow along. Have some local repositories to experiment with, as we may not have WiFi at the venue.
>
> *Note: you can totally corner me at the after-party if you have specific Git questions youâ€™d like to corner me about. Just as long as we talk about it over a beer.*
