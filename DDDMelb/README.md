# Git Workshops - DDD Melbourne

This workshop is divided into two sessions.

The first is a [Git Fundamentals](https://github.com/shiftkey/talks/blob/master/DDDMelb/git-fundamentals.md)
course, where we get started and run through some of the core concepts of Git.

The second is a bit more audience-driven, so there's a choice of topics which
we probably won't all address today:

 - [**The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective Gits**](https://github.com/shiftkey/talks/blob/master/DDDMelb/highly-effective-gits.md) - workflow tips and tricks
 - [**Branching Feels**](https://github.com/shiftkey/talks/blob/master/DDDMelb/branching-feels.md) - how to organize your team around Git
 - [**Understanding `cherry-pick` and `rebase`**](https://github.com/shiftkey/talks/blob/master/DDDMelb/cherry-pick-rebase.md) - How Can Git Be Both Immutable and Mutable?
 - [**Do you even commit?**](https://github.com/shiftkey/talks/blob/master/DDDMelb/git-internals.md) - a walk through Git Internals
